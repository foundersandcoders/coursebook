# Code of Conduct

All members are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
**All members of the community are expected to enforce this code** at every community event, class, gathering or exchange (such as [Founders and Coders classes](http://www.foundersandcoders.com) or our evening meetups, workshops and short courses), on our online forums (Slack and GitHub), and everywhere we interact under the [Founders and Coders](http://www.github.com/foundersandcoders) banner.

We expect cooperation from all participants in the community to _help ensure a safe environment for everybody_.

## The Quick Version

Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language, imagery or innuendo is not appropriate for any community event, including talks, workshops, parties, Slack, Twitter and other online media or channels. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and any future events, as well as the from the community itself, at the discretion of [the organisers, Founders and Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com).

## The Long Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

All those who interact with the community are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. It is the responsibility of _all_ to ensure that a sexualised environment is not created.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or community without further warning.

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please [contact an organiser immediately](#need-help).**

Particularly in the case of physical events, organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and contributions to the community.

We expect participants to follow these rules in all community interactions, whether professional, social or a mix of both.

If someone has violated these rules, please review the [Complaints Policy](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-membership/blob/master/complaints-policy.md) and make a complaint using our
[complaints form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbvvYpXwUp6lwFoityTUHYfrXgC3r8WH72LowXp5wFS9IxVA/viewform).
