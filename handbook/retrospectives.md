# Retrospectives

No matter how well a team works together, or how well a week goes, there is always an opportunity to learn and improve.

We end every week with a retrospective. It is a dedicated period of time for students & mentors
to deliberately reflect together on how we are doing and identify ways to improve.

## Cohort retrospective

We have found the simplest & most effective format to run retrospectives is what is called
a ["stop go continue"](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/sprint-retrospective) meeting.

The whole cohort of students sit in a circle, if space allows, with their mentors. Each student is given time to reflect on the week and identify specific things that we should:

- Stop doing
- Start doing
- Continue doing

The feedback can range broadly from environmental concerns, to timetabling, to feedback on workshops.

Once students have filled a whiteboard with their feedback, an assigned facilitator will read each point and they are discussed by the group. Every student votes at the end on a single "stop", "go", and "continue" item they consider the highest priority. The points with the most votes are then recorded as key action points.

The minutes of these meetings are captured ([London](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-curriculum), [Nazareth](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-curriculum), [Gaza](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/gaza-curriculum/tree/master/_stop-go-continue)), forwarded to mentors of future weeks, and used when we come to prepare for the next curriculum so that we can improve it as a group.

## Team retrospectives

We also run a smaller "stop go continue" meeting with each [student team](./teams.md) so they are able to reflect on how their group project work went that week.

At the end, each team member votes on three "stop" or "go" items they consider the highest priority. The three items with the most votes are then recorded, and taken forward as goals for the following week. Goals of prior weeks, and recurring items, are revisited in each project retrospective. Again, these are stored for reference in the respective curriculum repos: [London](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-curriculum), [Nazareth](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/nazareth-curriculum), [Gaza](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/gaza-curriculum).

### The Prime Directive

> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand." -- Norman Kerth

The above, what is called the "prime directive", is read out by a facilitator at the start of a project retrospective. The prime directive serves to remind us that no matter how difficult a project was, we do not default to blaming individuals. We work out as a group root causes behind problems, review the way we work together, and come up with actionable goals that will improve the next project for everyone.
