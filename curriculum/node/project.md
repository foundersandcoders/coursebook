# Node week project

Your project this week is to build a microblogging site. It should allow users to submit their own posts and view all the posts submitted by others.

**Note**: we aren't expecting the data to persist when the server restarts (we'll be looking at databases for this next week).

## User stories

### Core

- **As an opinionated person, I want to**: post my thoughts so others can read them
- **As a bored person, I want to**: read what other people have posted

### Stretch

- **As an impulsive person, I want to:** delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

### Acceptance Criteria

- A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- No client-side JavaScript
- All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- Tests for each server route
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
