# Single-page app project

Your project this week is to build a frontend for one of the APIs from REST API week. It should be a single-page app rendered with client-side JavaScript.

## User stories

### Core

- **As a user, I want to**: see all the resources
- **As a user, I want to**: sign up for an account
- **As a user, I want to**: log in to my account
- **As a user, I want to**: add my own resources

### Stretch

- **As a user, I want to**: update my own resources
- **As a user, I want to**: delete my own resources

Since this project is open-ended you'll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A single-page app (only one HTML file)
- [ ] Accessible signup/login forms
- [ ] Token-based authentication (storing token in localStorage)
- [ ] Form for adding new resources (only for logged in users)
- [ ] Works well across Chrome, Firefox and IE 10 browsers

#### Stretch criteria

- [ ] Buttons to delete existing resources (for logged in users)
- [ ] Form for updating existing resources (for logged in users)
