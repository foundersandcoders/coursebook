Your project this week is to build a web app that authenticates users and stores user-specific data in a PostgreSQL database.

## User stories

### Core

- **As a user, I want to**: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- **As a user, I want to**: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there
- **As a user, I want to**: be the only person allowed to delete my stuff

Since this project is open-ended you'll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Forms for users to sign up and log in
- [ ] A form for users to submit data only accessible to logged in users
- [ ] A page showing all the data
- [ ] A way for logged in users to delete their own data
- [ ] Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
- [ ] A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
- [ ] Tests for server routes and database access
- [ ] Not process user input as SQL commands
- [ ] Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)

#### Stretch criteria

- [ ] A user page that shows everything posted by a single user
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push

## Example project ideas
