Your challenge is to build an agency website for your team.

Your website should give potential clients:

- An introduction to your agency
- Information about each member of your team
- A way to get in touch if they are interested in working with you

## User Stories

_**A [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/) is a description of one or more features of a piece of software.**_

### Core Stories

**As a potential client, I want to:**

- See information about each member of your team so that I can know who you are
- Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage
- Contact you to enquire about working with you
- Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name

**Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:**

- Navigate your website using keyboard controls
- Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website

## Repository naming convention
Please name your repo following this template:
PRO01_Name1_Name2_Name3_Name4

## Acceptance Criteria

_**User stories come with [acceptance criteria](https://blog.easyagile.com/how-to-write-good-user-stories-in-agile-software-development-d4b25356b604?gi=dc603f56ed77) - a detailed scope of a user’s requirements.**_

- Navigation menu
- ‘About us’ section
- Contact form
- A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
- Information from the form doesn’t get submitted until the user clicks a button

### Stretch Goal

Use the automatic trigger functionality of your [GitHub project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).

Finally, feel free to get creative with the content of your website! Good luck!
