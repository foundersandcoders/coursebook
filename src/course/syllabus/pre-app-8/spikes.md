How would you effectively find out where (and why) an error is occurring in your JavaScript code?

### Questions to consider

1. What `console` methods are there other than `console.log`? Can these help us debug?
1. What does the `debugger;` statement do?
1. How do we use the debugger in our browser?

## Asynchronous JavaScript

How does JS handle asynchronous code?

### Questions to consider

1. What's the difference between "synchronous" and "asynchronous" code? Why might synchronous code be called "blocking"?
1. What are the event loop and the call stack?
1. How do callbacks and promises help us?

## Debugging network requests

How can we send and receive test network requests while working on an application?

### Questions to consider

1. How can we manually send test requests outside of our browser?
