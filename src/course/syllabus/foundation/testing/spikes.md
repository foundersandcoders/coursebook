## Advanced CSS

How can we use advanced CSS features to create complex custom components?

### Questions to consider

1. What are "combinator" selectors? Can you provide examples where they're useful?
1. What are pseudo-elements? Can you provide examples where they're useful?
1. How might you create custom-styled checkboxes using both of the above?

## Advanced DOM

How can we use advanced DOM features to make rendering complex UIs easier.

### Questions to consider

1. What is a NodeList?
   - How is it different from an array?
   - What's the different between "live" and "static" NodeLists?
1. What is the `<template>` element?
   - How can we use this to render dynamic UI?

## Testing methodologies

How do different testing methodologies try to improve the way we write tests?

### Questions to consider

1. What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)? Can it help us write better code?
1. What is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)? How do we translate user requirements into automated tests?
1. What is test coverage? Can this tell us about the _quality_ of our tests?
