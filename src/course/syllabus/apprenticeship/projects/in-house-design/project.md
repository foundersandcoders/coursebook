# Project

Your project in Design Week is to create a wireframe in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and test it with your user group.

Take ideas from your Definition workshop and the sketches you did there. You can consider the ideas you came up with there as _low-fidelity prototypes_ and with Figma, you'll create a _high-fidelity prototype_.

Your wireframe should include the main steps of the user journey. Think about which parts of the journey you'd like to get feedback on from your users and prioritise building these.
