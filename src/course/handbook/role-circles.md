# Role Circles

Role Circles are a chance to chat to members of other project teams, grouped by your responsibilities to your own teams. In the past, we've found that teams often encounter the same issues and that it can be easy to feel siloed in your own team.

## Structure

Role circles last for 15 minutes. Everyone in the group should get the opportunity to speak. You may prefer to nominate a facilitator at the beginning of the session.

## Focus

Focus on the challenges of the project related to your role. For example, if your role is Deployment you might like to discuss the architecture of the project. As a group of facilitators, you might like to discuss how you'll ensure everyone in your group is able to meet the week's learning outcomes.

Each week the challenges and focus of the project will change. Use this discussion as an opportunity to understand and share concerns and ideas across teams.
